Many are excited by the emerging possibilities for automatic code generation already available today. People unfamiliar with the development process imagine they will simply ask the computer for something in just a couple of phrases, and it will immediately provide them with the desired program. People who are more familiar with development understand that such an appealing prospect faces a whole series of serious obstacles.

Firstly, the longer the text, the more difficult it is to transform it into code without errors. Secondly, a computer system can accurately do everything the user wants only if the user can accurately articulate their need. People have a huge problem describing their needs in software products accurately â€“ usually, specifications are characterized by superficiality and inconsistency.
Therefore, we see our goal not only, and initially not so much, as implementing automatic code generation. First and foremost, we are creating an environment for the collective formation of precise, consistent, and structured graphical-textual specifications (or technical tasks) of any volume and complexity. These specifications enable the automatic generation of boilerplate code initially and then the full code of the software product with the possibility of manual refinement and adjustment.
